# Matter-Temperature-Humidity
This is an example of Matter project. It will try to report 2 different clusters at once(temperature, humidity) and these two attributes
would be updated every five minutes by a timer.

I only updated the files I added or changed. Also, I used the efr32-lock example as sample, so the platform is efr32.
This project is base on the Matter master version #993d0b94a0.
